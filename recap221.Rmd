- [X] The number of traces that are allowed by this model is infinite.
- [ ] The trace $\langle a, b, c, d, e \rangle$ is allowed by the model.
- [X] The trace $\langle a, c, d, c, b, d, c, e \rangle$ is allowed by the model.
- [ ] The shortest trace that is allowed by this model has a length of 4.
- [X] A complete trace always starts with activity a and ends with activity e .

Draw a directly-follows graph for each of the event logs. Which of them shows the weakness of illustrating concurrency.

- [ ] After executing a,b,c,d activities g, f, or e can occur.
- [X] The trace $\langle a, c, f, c, g \rangle$ is allowed by the model.
- [ ] The trace $\langle a, b, c, d, e, b, d, c, g \rangle$is allowed by the model.
